In this blog post, we will explore this topic without going into too much detail. Disclaimer: Some people are better at making friends, some people are better at maintaining friends, and some people are better at both. The only thing we can do, as people, is to change our behaviour in order to create and maintain healthy friendships.</description></item><item><title>How and Why Friends Are Unnecessary</title><link>https://nikodegtyaryov.github.io/how-and-why-friends-are-unnecessary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 20:41:58 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://nikodegtyaryov.github.io/how-and-why-friends-are-unnecessary/</guid><description>You might be thinking that this is a really strange topic to write about, especially for my first blog post. Yet, it is very relevant during the current pandemic situation, where lots of people lack social interaction. Everyone likes having friends, making friends, interacting with friends, etc - including myself. What do I mean when I say friends are unnecessary? We will explore the answer to this question in this blog post.</description></item></channel></rss>
